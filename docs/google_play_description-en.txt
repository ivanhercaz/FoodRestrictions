When traveling abroad, are you having a hard time getting your food restrictions
across?

This app is here to help you ordering food when you are traveling to a country where
language barriers can make it difficult to make yourself understood.

The purpose of this app is to help you to show the waiter, food vendor, etc. what kind of
food you don't eat or can't eat even if the they don't speak English or your language.

The best of all: you don't have to go through the trouble of drawing pictures or using
‘sign language’. All you have to do is configure your app to the language of the area
you are visiting.

This app has some Vegetarian and Vegan phrases in a few languages. All you need to do is select
the desired language in your app and you will instantly be able to show people your culinary
wishes using the menu on the left and choosing the language the other person speaks.

If the person who is cooking something for you can't read there is also an option where you can
select some icons to show what you don't eat or can't eat.

I developed this app to communicate my food preferences while traveling. I hope it will be
useful to you as well! 

Happy travels and Bon Appétit!.
